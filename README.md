### How to get posts from reddit using https://pushshift.io/
```Python
In [1]: from RAT.pushshift.get_data import Posts
In [2]: my_data = Posts(n=1, size=25, sub='askreddit')     
```


### Get posts in list format or in DataFrame format
```Python
In [3]: Posts_lst=my_data.get_post_list()    
In [4]: Posts_df=my_data.get_DataFrame() 
In [5]: Posts_lst 
```

```
Out[5]: 
[<RAT.pushshift.get_data.Post at 0x7f7de778deb8>,
 <RAT.pushshift.get_data.Post at 0x7f7de778d198>,
 <RAT.pushshift.get_data.Post at 0x7f7de778d0f0>,
...]
```

```Python
In [6]: Posts_df   
```

```
Out[6]:

### How to access post information from Posts object
```Python
In [7]: titles = [i.title for i in Posts_lst]  
```
```
Out[7]: 
['Redditors whoâ€™ve forgiven a significant other that cheated, why did you forgive them?',
 'What are some of the unwritten rules followed by men/women?',
 '911 operators of Reddit, what was the most ridiculous thing anyone has called you for?',

 # posts are different from Posts_df beacuse r/askreddit gets alot of new conetent and we only looked at 25 new ones
```

#### Converting unix time to utc:
```Python
In [8]: from RAT.pushshift.get_data import from_timestamp 
In [9]: created_utc = [from_timestamp(i.created_utc) for i in Posts_lst] 
In [10]: created_utc 
```
```
Out[10]: 
[datetime.datetime(2019, 5, 11, 18, 12, 43),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 5, 11, 18, 12, 43),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 5, 11, 18, 12, 41),
...]
```

## Working with saving posts:
### Saving posts to .json.gz
```Python
In [1]: from RAT.pushshift.get_data import Posts
In [2]: my_data = Posts(n=1, size=25, sub='askreddit')
In [3]: my_data.save_posts('askreddit_data.json.gz')    # saves .json from pushshift

0 - 2019-05-11 18:06:04    # time of last post
created: askreddit_data.json.gz
```

### Loading saved posts
```Python
In [4]: from RAT.pushshift.get_data import fPosts   
In [5]: my_file = fPosts('askreddit.json.gz')                                                                                                          
In [6]: my_file.get_posts_list(my_file.load_posts())     # load file and convert it to list of Post objects
```
```
